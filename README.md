A training tool for the Connect 4 game, based on the one created by the UC Berkeley GamesCrafters team (http://gamescrafters.berkeley.edu/). I have only really removed the config options screen and made a couple more minor adjustments, for example adding an "undo move" button to make it easier to analyse different paths through a game.
