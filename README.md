A training tool for the Connect 4 game, based on the one created by the UC Berkeley GamesCrafters team (http://gamescrafters.berkeley.edu/). I have removed the config options screen and made a couple of minor additions, for example adding a move counter, a loading/spinner image for when the move values are being fetched over the wire, and an "undo move" button to make it easier to analyse different paths through a game.
